# Game Store System (SDAT & DevOps QAP 1)

This is a simple Java CLI-based Game Store system built using Maven. It allows users to browse available games, add them to a cart, calculate the total, and simulate a checkout. The application uses **JUnit 5** for unit testing and **GitHub Actions** for automated test runs.

## Features

- Browse a catalog of games
- Add and remove games from the cart
- Calculate total cart price
- Checkout and clear the cart

## Unit Tests (JUnit 5)

Three unit tests have been written to validate:
- Game addition to the cart
- Game removal from the cart
- Total cart price calculation

## Technologies Used

- Java 23
- Maven (Build tool and dependency management)
- JUnit 5 (Testing)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD for test automation)

## Running the Project

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-store.git
